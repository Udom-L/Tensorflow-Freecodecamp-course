# Tensorflow - Full Freecodecamp lectures

- __This repository provided the updated lecture overview of [machine learning - Tensorflow courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) lectured by Tim Ruscica (i.e. [Tech with Tim](https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk)) and neural network courses by Brandon Rohrer. These lecture notes are also acknowledged by [CharityMiller](https://github.com/CharityMiller/Working-with-Tensorflow) for summarizing the lectures in the early version.__
