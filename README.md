# Tensorflow - Full Freecodecamp lectures

- __This repository provided the updated lecture overview of [machine learning - Tensorflow courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python) lectured by Tim Ruscica (i.e. [Tech with Tim](https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk)) and neural network courses by Brandon Rohrer. These lectures are also specially thanked by [CharityMiller](https://github.com/CharityMiller/Working-with-Tensorflow) for summarizing the lectures in the early version.__ 

- __We would like to especially acknowledge Tim Ruscica to provide such a valuable resource how to use Tensorflow library for developing Machine learning/Deep learning skills in the Data science field.__

- __The machine learning projects for Freecodecamp courses will hopefully be updated soon here.__
